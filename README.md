#Design-Teardown

This project aims to think about the visual weights elements take up in a [Smashing Magazine Website](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) by first creating a 'heat map' and then playhing around with different typefaces and weights.

This project is from [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-teardown).
